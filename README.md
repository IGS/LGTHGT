# LGTHGT
This repo will house both LGTView and LGTSeek code as LGTView is built to expect the output from 
a run of LGTSeek although it can be configured to run with other metadata inputs.

Please visit the [LGTView site](http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/labs/lgthgt/analysis/lgt-view/) to see examples and tutorial documents.

Unlike the previous repositories, this one will be all inclusive with both the Docker and base code.


- LGTView from https://github.com/jmatsumura/lgtview
- Docker LGTView from https://github.com/jmatsumura/docker_lgtview
- LGTSeek from https://github.com/jorvis/ergatis/ 
- Docker LGTSeek from https://github.com/adkinsrs/Ergatis-Docker 


LGTView and LGTSeek are originally from author/users ~rileydavidr and ~KSieber
